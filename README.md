WeChatBot - Powered by RAG and LLaMA 3.2
This repository contains a WeChatBot built using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, leveraging the LLaMA 3.2 language model and the FAISS vector database for efficient question answering. The bot is designed to handle WeChat queries by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base and generating accurate, context-aware responses.

Key Features
Advanced Language Model: Powered by LLaMA 3.2 for high-quality natural language understanding and generation.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Combines retrieval of contextually relevant information with generative responses for improved accuracy.
FAISS Vector Database: Efficient and scalable similarity search for fast information retrieval.
WeChat Integration: Seamlessly integrates with the WeChat platform for real-time messaging.
Architecture Overview
User Query: The user sends a query via WeChat.
Retrieval:
The query is vectorized and matched against a FAISS vector database to retrieve relevant documents.
Generation:
The retrieved documents, along with the user query, are fed into the LLaMA 3.2 model.
The model generates a response based on the combined context.
Response: The response is sent back to the user on WeChat.
